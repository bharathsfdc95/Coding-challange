Problem 1
Parse fixed width file
Generate a fixed width file using the provided spec (offset provided in the spec file represent the length of each field).
Implement a parser that can parse the fixed width file and generate a delimited file, like CSV for example.
DO NOT use python libraries like pandas for parsing. You can use the standard library to write out a csv file (If you feel like)
Language choices (Python or Scala)
